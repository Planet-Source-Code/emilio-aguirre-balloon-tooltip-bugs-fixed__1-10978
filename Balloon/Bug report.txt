BUGS FIXED:

1) 	First of all change this line :

	'Create Region 2: Tail of the balloon
	Reg(1) = CreatePolygonRgn(p(0), 3, 0)
	
	for this :

	'Create Region 2: Tail of the balloon
	Reg(1) = CreatePolygonRgn(p(0), 3, 1)

	in the ChangeStyle() subrutine

2) Place the On Error Resume Next statement in the
   Search_Wnd subrutine like this:

	Public Sub Search_Wnd()
	  Dim curhWnd As Long
	  Dim p As POINTAPI
	  Static oldhWnd As Long
	  Dim blnFound As Boolean
	  Dim ctrl As Control
  ===> add this code
	  On Error Resume Next
  ===> end of modifications

3) Add the following lines after the HideTip Statement in 
the Search_Wnd() rutine:

 If (m_oldhWnd <> curhWnd) Then
         blnFound = False
         HideTip
=====> add here the following lines:

         'Check if mouse its over the form
         If curhWnd = UserControl.Parent.hWnd Then
              m_oldhWnd = curhWnd
              Exit Sub
         End If

======> End of modifications


4) Try it again!
